            <h2>Vault Music</h2>
            <p>Vault music is a belfast based promotional agency putting on local gigs to give smaller bands and artists a chance to break out in the scene. They approached me to create a logo for them and help with branding.</p>

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>When Vault music approached me with their idea for what they wanted their company to represent in the belfast music scene, a safe place for young adults to discover new bands and music genres. I knew that the branding would have to be striking and memorable while also staying simple as the logo would be used on t-shirts, stickers and other merchandise. I started mindmapping and sketching to get a feel for what direction I wanted to take this logo. I settled on using the simple shape of a large bank vault to give off a sense of security. The VM monogram came about by looking at some companies similar to VM. Using this knowledge, I created a sleek monogram that could be used in a proffesional setting like on a business card or be easily scribbled onto a drum kit at the last minute.</p>

            <h2>Wordmark</h2>
            <p>After the logo was finished, My client asked if I could create a wordmark for them to be used on some other promotional material aswell as on a tshirt. I wanted to keep the wordmark as similar to the logo. This meant keeping it simple enough that it could be scribbled onto band equipment, but also giving it a distinct element so as to give it some character. I settled on using the font MANROPE and adding a small negative space on the A. </p>
